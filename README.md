Weapon for Evaluation and Analysis of Solr/Lucene
The WEASL, is a python tool for working with Solr indexes.  It's biggest
strength is that it makes it easier to work with multiple cores in a solr
installation.  It allows querying a single core, or executing the same query
across all cores.  It also contains methods for counting the number of results
for a given query across a single core, or across multiple cores.
